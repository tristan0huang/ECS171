# ECS171
Preprocessing: We are changing the date feature by omitting the dashes in the 'date' data inputs and then converting them into integers, that way we change them all into 8 digit int variables. We will also change the genre feature from an array of strings into a codefied array of int variables. It will remain an array since the movies are classified under multiple categories, but all the genres seem to repeat, so they will be easily codefied into ints. Same goes for the Production companies, they are currently array's of strings listing the production companies involved in the making of the movie, however we will just convert the string values into int values. We will drop the title column as well as the tagline column since there is no way of codefying them in a repeatable manner. For the budget column and revenue, there are about 80% of data points missing (i.e. they are listed as zero), so it is probably not possible to omitt these, so instead we probably will just ignore these columns but keep the datapoints in.
